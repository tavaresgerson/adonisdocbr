AdonisJs has out of the box support for handling file uploads. You can easily manage *bulk uploads*, *file size/extension validation* and add global checks to deny requests containing more than expected payload.

== Basic Example

Let's take an example of uploading user avatar. We will consider this as a **PUT** request to upload the user profile avatar and run necessary validations to make sure the user is uploading the right file.

.app/Http/routes.js
[source, javascript]
----
Route.put('/users/:id/avatar', 'UsersController.updateAvatar')
----

Next, you need to create the `updateAvatar` method in `UsersController`.

.app/Http/Controllers/UsersController.js
[source, javascript]
----
'use strict'

const Helpers = use('Helpers')
const User = use('App/Model/User')

class UserController {

  * updateAvatar (request, response) {

    const avatar = request.file('avatar', { <1>
      maxSize: '2mb',
      allowedExtensions: ['jpg', 'png', 'jpeg']
    })

    const userId = request.param('id')
    const user = yield User.findOrFail(userId)

    const fileName = `${new Date().getTime()}.${avatar.extension()}` <2>
    yield avatar.move(Helpers.storagePath(), fileName) <3>

    if (!avatar.moved()) {
      response.badRequest(avatar.errors())
      return
    }

    user.avatar = avatar.uploadPath() <4>
    yield user.save()
    response.ok('Avatar updated successfully')
  }
}
module.exports = UsersController
----

<1> First we get a file object from the `request` object. Additionally we can define `maxSize` and `allowedExtensions` to validate the file.
<2> It is important to rename the file, same is done by grabbing the current date time and appending the file extension to it.
<3> Next, we call the move operation on the file instance. Any validation errors will be returned using `errors()` method.
<4> If all went fine, we set the path of avatar next to the user model object and persist it to the database.

== Config

The configuration for the file uploads is stored inside `config/bodyParser.js` file.

.config/bodyParser.js
[source, javascript]
----
uploads: {
  multiple: true,
  hash: false,
  maxSize: '2mb'
}
----

1. The `maxSize` is calculated on all the uploaded files, which means uploading two files of `1.5mb` each will exceed this limit.
2. The `maxSize` check is performed right at the beginning. This makes sure that attackers are not choking your servers by sending **Gigabytes** of data.

== File Instance

The `request.file` method returns an instance of the `File` class, which has a handful of methods to retrieve uploaded file information and move it to a given path.

Uploading multiple files return an array of `File` class instances. For example:

[source, javascript]
----
const profilePics = request.file('profile[]')
// profilePics will be an array
----

== Validation

**File instance** can manage validation on file size and extensions for you. You just need to pass the options when accessing the instance.

[source, javascript]
----
const avatar = request.file('avatar', {
  maxSize: '2mb',
  allowedExtensions: ['jpg', 'png']
})
----

Now when you will call the `move` method, the validations will fire based on the defined configuration. In case, if above validations are not enough for you, you can implement your own `validate` method.

=== Manual Validation
Returning *true* or *false* from the `validate` method will define whether the validation has been passed or not. Also, you will be responsible for setting the error message on the file instance manually.

[source, javascript]
----
const avatar = request.file('avatar')

avatar.validate = function () {
  if (avatar.extension() !== 'foo') {
    avatar._setError('We support foo files only')
    return false
  }
  return true
}
----

== File Instance Methods
Below is the list of available methods on File instance.

==== clientName
Returns the name of the uploaded file.

[source, javascript]
----
avatar.clientName()
----

==== clientSize
Returns the size of the file (in bytes).

[source, javascript]
----
avatar.clientSize()
----

==== mimeType
Returns file mime-type.

[source, javascript]
----
avatar.mimeType()
----

==== extension
Returns file extension.

[source, javascript]
----
avatar.extension()
----

==== tmpPath
The path to the temporary folder, where the file was uploaded.

[source, javascript]
----
avatar.tmpPath()
----

==== exists
Tells whether the file exists inside the temporary folder or not.

[source, javascript]
----
avatar.exists()
----

==== move(toPath, [newName])
Move the file to a given location with an optional name. If `newName` is not defined, it will make use of `clientName()`

[source, javascript]
----
yield avatar.move(Helpers.storagePath())
----

==== delete()
Delete file from the `tmp` directory after the file has been moved.

[source, javascript]
----
yield avatar.delete()
----

==== moved
Tells whether the move operation was successful or not.

[source, javascript]
----
yield avatar.move(Helpers.storagePath())

if (avatar.moved()) {
    // moved successfully
}
----

==== errors
Returns errors occurred during the `move` process.

[source, javascript]
----
yield avatar.move(Helpers.storagePath())

if (!avatar.moved()) {
  response.send(avatar.errors())
}
----

==== uploadPath

Full path to the upload directory with the file name.

[source, javascript]
----
yield avatar.move(Helpers.storagePath())

avatar.uploadPath()
----

==== uploadName
Name of the uploaded file.

[source, javascript]
----
yield avatar.move(Helpers.storagePath(), 'selfie.jpg')
avatar.uploadName()
----

NOTE:: `uploadPath` and `uploadName` will only be available after the move operation.

==== toJSON
Returns **JSON** representation of the file properties.
[source, javascript]
----
avatar.toJSON()
----
