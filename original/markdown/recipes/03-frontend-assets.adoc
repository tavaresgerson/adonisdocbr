= Managing frontend assets

toc::[]

AdonisJs does not make any assumptions, neither provide tools on how to bundle your frontend assets. The goal of the framework is to provide a productive workflow for backend applications only.

Whereas, in this recipe, we discuss some ways on how you can go about managing and bundling your frontend code.

== Webpack
There are so many build tools in the frontend eco-system that it is quite easy to feel overwhelming. However, link:https://webpack.js.org/concepts/[webpack, window="_blank"] *(as of now)* does manage everything gracefully and is the popular choice for many devs.

Let's see how to go about storing your assets and then bundling them.

=== Directory structure
[source, bash]
----
└── resources
    └── assets
        └── sass
        └── scripts
        └── images
----

We should keep all `source assets` inside the `resources` directory. This directory is already used by Adonis to store the views.

All compiled assets from this directory are placed inside the `public` directory.

=== Webpack base config
First, make sure to install webpack as a dev dependency and create the config file.

[source, bash]
----
npm i --save-dev webpack webpack-cli

touch webpack.config.js
----

.webpack.config.js
[source, js]
----
module.exports = {
}
----

Run `./node_modules/.bin/webpack` to build your files.

- Use the flag `--mode` to choose between production and development.
- To start the watcher, make use of `--watch` flag.

example
[source, bash]
----
./node_modules/.bin/webpack --mode development
----

== Sass setup

[source, bash]
----
npm i --save-dev style-loader css-loader extract-text-webpack-plugin@next node-sass sass-loader
----

Add following code to your webpack.config.js file.

[source, js]
----
const ExtractTextPlugin = require('extract-text-webpack-plugin')

const extractSass = new ExtractTextPlugin({
  filename: 'public/app.css'
})

function sassRules () {
  return [
    {
      test: /\.(sass|scss)$/,
      use: ExtractTextPlugin.extract(
        {
          fallback: 'style-loader',
          use: ['css-loader', 'sass-loader']
        })
    }
  ]
}

module.exports = {
  entry: [
    './resources/assets/sass/app.scss'
  ],
  output: {
    filename: 'public/app.js'
  },
  module: {
    rules: sassRules()
  },
  plugins: [
    extractSass
  ]
}
----

Here we make use of `sass-loader` and some related dependencies to compile `resources/assets/sass/app.scss -> public/app.css`.

Require css file from `edge` templates.

[source, edge]
----
<head>
  {{ style('/public/app') }}
</head>
----


== Scripts setup
The scripts setup is done to bundle your frontend JavaScript into a single file. I assume that you want to compile code to ES5 to target all major browsers.

NOTE: We use babel for ES6 to ES5 transpilation. Also *AdonisJs itself does not need babel*, it is just for the JavaScript you are writing for the browser.

[source, bash]
----
npm i --save-dev babel-loader @babel/core @babel/preset-env
----

[source, js]
----
function scriptRules () {
  return [
    {
      test: /\.js$/,
      exclude: [/node_modules/],
      loader: 'babel-loader',
      options: { presets: ['env'] }
    }
  ]
}

module.exports = {
  entry: [
    './resources/assets/sass/app.scss',
    './resources/assets/scripts/app.js'
  ],
  output: {
    filename: 'public/app.js'
  },
  module: {
    rules: sassRules().concat(scriptRules())
  },
  plugins: [
    extractSass
  ]
}
----

This time we compile `resources/assets/scripts/app.js -> public/app.js`

Require js file from `edge` templates.

[source, edge]
----
<head>
  {{ script('/public/app') }}
</head>
----
