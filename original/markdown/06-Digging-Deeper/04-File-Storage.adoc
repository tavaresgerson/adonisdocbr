AdonisJs has a dedicated *Drive Provider* built on top of link:https://github.com/Slynova-Org/node-flydrive[Flydrive] to interact with local and remote file systems like *Amazon S3*.

In this guide, we learn how to set up and use the *Drive Provider*.

== Setup
As the *Drive Provider* is not installed by default, we need to pull it from `npm`:

[source, bash]
----
> adonis install @adonisjs/drive
----

Next, we need to register the provider inside the `start/app.js` file:

.start/app.js
[source, js]
----
const providers = [
  '@adonisjs/drive/providers/DriveProvider'
]
----

NOTE: Driver configuration is saved inside the `config/drive.js` file, which is created by the `adonis install` command when installing the *Drive Provider*.

== Available Drivers
The default drivers shipped with the *Drive Provider* are:

[ol-shrinked]
1. Amazon S3 (`s3`), which requires the link:https://www.npmjs.com/package/aws-sdk[aws-sdk, window="_blank"] package
2. DigitalOcean Spaces (`spaces`), which requires the link:https://www.npmjs.com/package/aws-sdk[aws-sdk, window="_blank"] package
2. Local file system (`local`)

== Basic Example
Here's a basic example of how to interact with the local disk via `adonis repl`:

== Drive API
While common operations like reading and writing remain the same across drivers, the API of a drive is mainly based upon the driver you're using to interact with that drive's file system.

==== exists(relativePath)
Find if a file/directory exists or not:

[source, js]
----
const exists = await Drive.exists('unicorn.jpg')
----

==== get(relativePath, encoding = utf-8)
Get file contents as a buffer or string:

[source, js]
----
const unicorn = await Drive.get('unicorn.jpg')
----

==== getStream(relativePath)
Get file as a stream:

[source, js]
----
Drive.getStream('hello.txt')
----

==== put(relativePath, content, options = {})
Create a new file with given contents (creates any missing directories):

[source, js]
----
await Drive.put('hello.txt', Buffer.from('Hello world!'))
----

==== prepend(relativePath, content, options = {})
Prepend content to a file (creates a new file if path doesn't exist):

[source, js]
----
await Drive.prepend('hello.txt', Buffer.from('Prepended!'))
----

NOTE: The `prepend` method only works with the local driver.

==== append(relativePath, content, options = {})
Append content to a file (creates a new file if path doesn't exist):

[source, js]
----
await Drive.append('hello.txt', Buffer.from('Appended!'))
----

NOTE: The `append` method only works with the local driver.

==== delete(relativePath)
Remove existing file:

[source, js]
----
await Drive.delete('hello.txt')
----

==== move(src, dest, options = {})
Move file from one directory to another:

[source, js]
----
await Drive.move('hello.txt', 'hi.txt')
----

==== copy(src, dest, options = {})
Copy file from one directory to another:

[source, js]
----
await Drive.copy('hi.txt', 'hello.txt')
----

== S3/Spaces API
The following methods work for the `s3` and `spaces` drivers only.

==== getObject(location, params)
Get S3 object for a given file (for `params` info, see link:http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaScriptSDK/latest/AWS/S3.html#getObject-property[S3 params]):

[source, js]
----
await Drive.disk('s3').getObject('unicorn.jpg')
----

==== getUrl(location, [bucket])
Get url for a given file (accepts optional alternative `bucket` param):

[source, js]
----
const url = Drive.disk('s3').getUrl('unicorn.jpg')
----

==== getSignedUrl(location, expiry = 900, params)
Get signed url for a given file (expiry set to `15mins` by default):

[source, js]
----
const url = await Drive.disk('s3').getSignedUrl('unicorn.jpg')
----
