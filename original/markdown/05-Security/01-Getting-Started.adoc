AdonisJs provides a handful of tools to keep your websites secure from common web attacks.

In this guide, we learn about the best practices to keep your AdonisJs applications secure.

NOTE: If you discover any security bugs, mailto:virk@adonisjs.com[please inform us immediately via email]. Do not create GitHub issues, as this may impact applications running in production. Found issues will be disclosed once patches have been pushed to the codebase.

== Session Security
Sessions can leak important information if not handled with care.

AdonisJs encrypts and signs all cookies using the `appKey` defined in the `config/app.js` file.

Keep your `appKey` secret â€“ don't share it with anyone, and never push it to version control systems like Github.

=== Session Config
Session configuration is saved inside the `config/session.js` file.

When updating your session configuration, considering the following suggestions:

[ul-spaced]
* The `httpOnly` value should be set to `true`, as setting it to `false` will make your cookies accessible via JavaScript using `document.cookie`.
* The `sameSite` value should also be set to `true`, ensuring your session cookie is not visible/accessible via different domains.

== Form Method Spoofing
As HTML forms are only capable of making `GET` and `POST` requests, you cannot use HTTP verbs like `PUT` or `DELETE` to perform resourceful operations via a form's `method` attribute.

To work around this, AdonisJs implements link:request#_method_spoofing[form method spoofing], enabling you to send your intended HTTP method via the request URL's `_method` query string parameter:

.Route
[source, javascript]
----
Route.put('/users/:id', 'UserController.update')
----

.View
[source, html]
----
<form action="/users/1?_method=PUT" method="POST">
</form>
----

In the example above, appending `?_method=PUT` to the form's `action` URL converts the request HTTP method from `POST` to `PUT`.

Here are a couple of things you should know about method spoofing:

[ul-spaced]
* AdonisJs only spoofs methods where the source HTTP method is `POST`, meaning `GET` requests passing an intented HTTP `_method` are not spoofed.
* Method spoofing can be disabled by setting `allowMethodSpoofing` to `false` inside the `config/app.js` file:
+
.config/app.js
[source, javascript]
----
http: {
  allowMethodSpoofing: false
}
----

== File Uploads
Attackers often try to upload malicious files to servers to later execute and gain access to servers to perform some kind of destructive activity.

Besides uploading malicious files, attackers may also try to upload *huge* files so you server stays busy uploading and starts throwing *TIMEOUT* errors for subsequent requests.

To combat this scenario, AdonisJs lets you define the *maximum upload size* processable by your server. This means any file larger than the specified `maxSize` is denied, keeping your server in a healthy state.

Set your `maxSize` value inside the `config/bodyParser.js` file:

.config/bodyParser.js
[source, javascript]
----
uploads: {
  maxSize: '2mb'
}
----

Here are a few tips to consider when handling file uploads:

[ul-spaced]
* Rename user files before uploading/storing.
* Don't store uploaded files inside the `public` directory, since `public` files can be accessed directly.
* Don't share the actual location of uploaded files with your users. Instead, consider saving a reference to uploaded file paths in your database (each file having a *unique id*), and set up a route to serve those uploaded files via `id`, like so:
+
.start/routes.js
[source, javascript]
----
const Helpers = use('Helpers')

Route.get('download/:fileId', async ({ params, response }) => {
  const file = await Files.findorFail(params.fileId)
  response.download(Helpers.tmpPath('uploads/${file.path}'))
})
