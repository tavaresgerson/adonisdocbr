= Hooks

toc::[]

*Hooks* are actions performed before or after database link:#_lifecycle_events[lifecycle events].

Using model hooks helps keep your codebase link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself[DRY, window="_blank"], providing convenient lifecycle code injection from wherever your hooks are defined.

A classic hook example is link:encryption-and-hashing#_hashing_values[hashing] the user password before saving the user to a database.

== Defining Hooks
Hooks can be defined in a model class file via a closure, or by referencing any `file.method` handler in the `app/Models/Hooks` directory.

=== Binding Closure
[source, js]
----
const Model = use('Model')
const Hash = use('Hash')

class User extends Model {
  static boot () {
    super.boot()

    this.addHook('beforeCreate', async (userInstance) => {
      userInstance.password = await Hash.make(userInstance.password)
    })
  }
}

module.exports = User
----

=== Hook Within Transactions
To use hooks within link:lucid#_transactions[transactions] just add second param `trx` into hook closure

[source, js]
----
const Model = use('Model')
const Hash = use('Hash')

class User extends Model {
  static boot () {
    super.boot()

    this.addHook('beforeCreate', async (userInstance, trx) => {
      // here you can use transaction object `trx`
    })
  }
}

module.exports = User
----

In the example above, the `beforeCreate` closure is executed when creating a `User` model to ensure the user's password is hashed before it's saved.

=== Hook File
AdonisJs has a dedicated `app/Models/Hooks` directory to store model hooks.

Use the `make:hook` command to create a hook file:

[source, bash]
----
> adonis make:hook User
----

.Output
[source, bash]
----
âœ” create  app/Models/Hooks/UserHook.js
----

Open the new `UserHook.js` file and paste in the code below:

.app/Models/Hooks/UserHook.js
[source, js]
----
'use strict'

const Hash = use('Hash')

const UserHook = exports = module.exports = {}

UserHook.hashPassword = async (user) => {
  user.password = await Hash.make(user.password)
}
----

With a hook `file.method` defined, we can remove the inline closure from our link:#_binding_closure[previous example] and instead reference the hook file and method like so:

[source, js]
----
const Model = use('Model')

class User extends Model {
  static boot () {
    super.boot()
    this.addHook('beforeCreate', 'UserHook.hashPassword')
  }
}

module.exports = User
----

== Aborting Database Operations
Hooks can abort database operations by throwing exceptions:

.app/Models/Hooks/UserHook.js
[source, javascript]
----
UserHook.validate = async (user) => {
  if (!user.username) {
    throw new Error('Username is required')
  }
}
----

== Lifecycle Events
Below is the list of available database lifecycle events to hook into:

[options="header", cols="35, 65"]
|====
| Event | Description
| `beforeCreate` | Before creating a new record.
| `afterCreate` | After a new record is created.
| `beforeUpdate` | Before updating a record.
| `afterUpdate` | After a record has been updated.
| `beforeSave` | Before *creating or updating* a new record.
| `afterSave` | After a new record has been *created or updated*.
| `beforeDelete` | Before removing a record.
| `afterDelete` | After a record is removed.
| `afterFind` | After a single record is fetched from the database.
| `afterFetch` | After the `fetch` method is executed. The hook method receives an array of model instances.
| `afterPaginate` | After the `paginate` method is executed. The hook method receives two arguments: an array of model instances and the pagination metadata.
|====
