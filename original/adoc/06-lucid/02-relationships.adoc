= Relationships

toc::[]

Relational Databases are very powerful in managing the relationship between multiple database tables. Lucid extends this power by offering Javascript-only database associations, which means that you can define a relationship between two tables without touching the SQL schema.

== Basic Example
Relational databases are intended to define relations between two or more database tables. There are several benefits of defining relationships as they make common database operations a lot easier.

Let's take the most common scenario of a User and a Profile model. Where every user in your database can have a social profile. We call this a *one to one relationship*.

To describe this relationship, you will have to add following line of code to your User model.

.app/Model/User.js
[source, javascript]
----
'use strict'

const Lucid = use('Lucid')

class User extends Lucid {

  profile () {
    return this.hasOne('App/Model/Profile') <1>
  }

}
----

<1> The `hasOne` method defines a one to one relationship on a given model.

Now you can call the `profile` method to access the profile for a given user.

[source, javascript]
----
const user = yield User.find(1)
const userProfile = yield user.profile().fetch()
----

== Types Of Relationships

=== Has One Relationship
The `hasOne` relationship defines a one to one relation between 2 models using a foreign key. Foreign Key is created using the singular name of a given model followed by *_id*. However, you are free to override it.

[options="header"]
|====
| Model | Foreign Key
| User | user_id
| Seller | seller_id
|====

To setup the relationship shown in the above figure, you need to define it inside your User model.

==== hasOne(relatedModel, [primaryKey=id], [foreignKey=user_id])

.app/Model/User.js
[source, javascript]
----
class User extends Lucid {

  profile () {
    return this.hasOne('App/Model/Profile')
  }

}
----

=== BelongsTo Relationship
The `belongsTo` relationship is the opposite of `hasOne` and always holds the *foreign key*. So the best way to remember it is with the foreign key. Any database table that has the foreign key, it's Model will always have the `belongsTo` relation.

There are no hard rules on how to design your relationships, but it is always nice to design them in the most natural way. For example

[options="header"]
|====
| Model | Relation | Related Model
| User | hasOne | Profile
| Profile | belongsTo | User
| Student | hasOne | IdCard
| IdCard | belongsTo | User
|====

Hope this makes sense. Continuing with our *User* *Profile* relationship, the Profile model will contain the `belongsTo` relation as it holds the foreign key.

==== belongsTo(relatedModel, [primaryKey=id], [foreignKey=user_id])

.app/Model/Profile.js
[source, javascript]
----
class Profile extends Lucid {

  user () {
    return this.belongsTo('App/Model/User')
  }

}
----

=== HasMany Relationship
You will find yourself using `hasMany` quite often, as this is the most common relationship required by any application. Let's review some examples.

[options="header"]
|====
| Model | Relation | Related Model
| Book | hasMany | Chapter
| Chapter | belongsTo | Book
| Post | hasMany | Comment
| Comment | belongsTo | Post
|====

The `hasMany` relationship makes it possible to have multiple related records for a given row each holding the foreignKey.

image:http://res.cloudinary.com/adonisjs/image/upload/v1472841272/has-many_p91i9i.jpg[]

Let's define the above Models and their relationships in Lucid.

==== hasMany(relatedModel, [primaryKey=id], [foreignKey=book_id])

.app/Model/Book.js
[source, javascript]
----
class Book extends Lucid {

  chapters () {
    return this.hasMany('App/Model/Chapter')
  }

}
----

.app/Model/Chapter.js
[source, javascript]
----
class Chapter extends Lucid {

  book () {
    return this.belongsTo('App/Model/Book')
  }

}
----

=== BelongsToMany Relationship
There are situations where each side of the relationship can have many related rows inside the database. Let's see some examples.

[options="header"]
|====
| Model | Relation | Related Model
| Student | belongsToMany | Courses
| Course | belongsToMany | Students
| Post | belongsToMany | Categories
| Category | belongsToMany | Posts
|====

Taking the example of Student and Course, where both models can have many related rows in the database. In other words, it is a *many to many relationship*.

image:http://res.cloudinary.com/adonisjs/image/upload/v1472841273/belongsto-many_ymawpb.jpg[]

Looking at the above figure, you will notice there is a 3rd table called `course_student`. Since each model on both the ends has many relationships, they cannot hold the foreign key.

The third table is known as a *pivot table*.  It holds the Foreign Key for both Models and defines a unique relationship between them. Let's define this relationship in Lucid and review configurable options.

==== belongsToMany(relatedModel, [pivotTable], [localKey], [otherKey])
.app/Model/Student.js
[source, javascript]
----
class Student extends Lucid {

  courses () {
    return this.belongsToMany('App/Model/Course')
  }

}
----

.app/Model/Course.js
[source, javascript]
----
class Course extends Lucid {

  students () {
    return this.belongsToMany('App/Model/Student')
  }

}
----

The `belongsToMany` method accepts multiple arguments to configure the table/fields for the relationship.

[options="header"]
|====
| Parameter | Required | Default Value
| pivotTable  | No | Pivot table is the singular form of each model name, order by name. For example Course and Student model will have *course_student* as the pivot table name.
| localKey  | No | Reference to the model foreign key inside the pivot table.
| otherKey  | No | Reference to the related model foreign key inside the pivot table.
|====

==== withTimestamps
Also you choose to save timestamps on the pivot table.

[source, javascript]
----
class Student extends Lucid {
  courses () {
    this.belongsToMany('App/Model/Course').withTimestamps()
  }
}
----

=== HasManyThrough Relationship
Another important relation type supported by Lucid is `hasManyThrough`. Where a given model is dependent on another model via 3rd model

image:http://res.cloudinary.com/adonisjs/image/upload/v1472841274/has-many-through_vux5jm.jpg[]

Taking the example of fetching *posts* for a given *country* is not possible since there is no direct relationship between countries and posts. But with the help of User model, we can set up an indirect relationship between countries and posts and that is called `hasManyThrough` relationship.

.app/Model/Country.js
[source, javascript]
----
class Country extends Lucid {

  posts () {
    return this.hasManyThrough('App/Model/Post', 'App/Model/User')
  }

}
----

Now to fetch posts for a given country, you need to call the `posts` method on the *Country model*.

[source, javascript]
----
const country = yield Country.findBy('name', 'India')
const posts = yield country.posts().fetch()
response.json(posts)
----

The `hasManyThrough` method accepts given options.

[options="header"]
|====
| Parameter | Required  | Default Value
| relatedModel | Yes | null
| throughModel | Yes | null
| primaryKey | No | Model primary key
| foreignKey | No | Model foreign key
| throughPrimaryKey | No | Related model primary key
| throughForeignKey | No | Related model foreign key
|====

== Querying Relationships
Querying database for relationships is so straightforward and intuitive with Lucid. You just have to call defined relationship methods without worrying about the *join* queries.

Also querying relations is divided into three broad categories of *Lazy Loading*, *Eager Loading* and *Lazy Eager Loading*.

=== Lazy Loading
Lazy loading is a process of loading relationships after fetching the primary/parent record from the database

[source, javascript]
----
class User extends Lucid {

  profile () {
    return this.hasOne('App/Model/Profile')
  }

}
----

[source, javascript]
----
const user = yield User.find(1) <1>
const profile = yield user.profile().fetch() <2>
----

<1> First we `find` a user with the primary key.
<2> Then we call the previously defined `profile` method to fetch the related profile for the given user.

==== Defining Query Constraints
You can also attach query builder methods to your relationship definitions, and Lucid will make sure to execute them.

[source, javascript]
----
class User extends Lucid {

  profile () {
    return this
      .hasOne('App/Model/Profile')
      .where('is_active', true) <1>
  }

}
----

<1> Now when you will fetch the related profile for a given user, it will only include the record where is_active=true.

==== Runtime Query Constraints
You can also define runtime query constraints, just by chaining the query builder methods.

[source, javascript]
----
const user = yield User.find(1)
const profile = user
  .profile()
  .where('is_active', true)
  .fetch()
----

=== Eager Loading
Lazy loading may create *N+1* problem in certain scenarios. For example Loading profile for ten users, one by one will make a total of *11* queries. To eliminate this behavior you can preload/eager load profiles which will result in a total of *2* database queries.

[source, javascript]
----
const users = yield User
  .query()
  .with('profile') <1>
  .fetch()

console.log(users.toJSON())
----

.Output
[source, javascript]
----
[
  {
    id: 1,
    username: 'joe',
    email: '...',
    profile: {
      id: 4,
      avatar: '...'
    }
  }
]
----

<1> The `with` method can be used to eager load relationships with the parent record. Also, you can load multiple/nested relationships using the `with` method.

==== Eager Loading Multiple Relations

[source, javascript]
----
const users = yield User
  .query()
  .with('profile', 'friends')
  .fetch()
----

==== Eager Loading Nested Relations

[source, javascript]
----
const user = yield User
  .query()
  .with('friends.profile')
  .fetch()
----

==== Runtime Query Constraints
Also, you can build upon the query builder to filter the results from the related models.

[source, javascript]
----
const user = yield User
  .with('profile', 'friends')
  .scope('profile', (builder) => {
    builder.where('is_active', true)
  }) <1>
  .scope('friends', (builder) => {
    builder.orderBy('rank', 'desc')
  })
  .fetch()
----

<1> The `scope` method gives you the access to the query builder of the related model which means you can add `where` clause to filter the results.

=== Lazy Eager Loading
Lazy eager loading is a combination of xref:_lazy_loading[Lazy loading] and xref:_eager_loading[Eager Loading] instead of preloading all the relationships, you fetch the parent model instance and then eager load all related models.

[source, javascript]
----
const user = yield User.find(1)
yield user.related('profile', 'friends').load()

console.log(user.toJSON())
----

.Output
[source, javascript]
----
[
  {
    id: 1,
    username: 'joe',
    email: '...',
    profile: {
      id: 4,
      avatar: '...'
    }
  }
]
----

== Filtering Records

NOTE: Supported by adonis-lucid 3.0.13 or greater

A quite common use case is to filter top-level results based upon some conditions on a relationship. For example:

1. Display all users who have contributed at least one post.
2. Fetch all cars with 2 or more owners in a lifetime.

Ideally, it requires some complex joins, but Lucid makes it so easier for you.

==== has(relation, [expression], [value])

[source, javascript]
----
class User extends Lucid {

  posts () {
    return this.hasMany('App/Model/Post')
  }

}

// filtering
const users = yield User.query().has('posts').fetch()

// two or more
const users = yield User.query().has('posts', '>=', 2).fetch()
----

==== whereHas(relation, callback, [expression], [value])

[source, javascript]
----
const users = yield User.query().whereHas('posts', (builder) => {
  builder.where('is_published', true)
}).fetch()
----

Also, you can make use of `doesntHave` and `whereDoesntHave` methods, which are opposite of the above ones.

==== doesntHave(relation)

[source, javascript]
----
const users = yield User.query().doesntHave('friends').fetch()
----

==== whereDoesntHave(relation, callback)

[source, javascript]
----
const users = yield User.query().whereDoesntHave('friends', (builder) => {
  builder.where('is_verified', false)
}).fetch()
----

=== Counting Related Models
Getting counts of relationships is commonly used by web applications. For example: *Fetching comments count for every post*.

==== withCount(relation)

[source, javascript]
----
class Post extends Lucid {

  comments () {
    this.hasMany('App/Model/Comment')
  }

}

// fetching counts
const posts = yield Posts.query().withCount('comments').fetch()

console.log(posts.first().comments_count)
----

== Insert, Updates & Deletes
Relationships can also be *created*, *updated* and *deleted* with the same ease as fetching them. Whereas each relationship type has slightly different methods to persist related data.

==== save(modelInstance, [pivotValues])
The `save` method can be used to create/update related model instance. It works with following relations.

NOTE:: `pivotValues` are only supported by *belongsToMany* relationship. Checkout xref:_attach_rows_pivotvalues[attach] method documentation on how pivotValues are defined.

[support-list]
1. hasOne
2. hasMany
3. belongsToMany

[source, javascript]
----
const user = yield User.find(1)

const profile = new Profile()
profile.name = '@cybernox'
profile.avatar =  '...'

yield user.profile().save(profile)
----

==== create(values, [pivotValues])
The `create` method is almost similar to the `save` method whereas you pass an arbitrary object instead of passing a model instance.

[source, javascript]
----
const user = yield User.find(1)

yield user
  .profile()
  .create({name: '@cybernox', avatar: '...'})
----

==== saveMany(arrayOfInstances)
Save multiple related records for a given model instance. `saveMany` works with following relation types.

1. hasMany
2. belongsToMany

[source, javascript]
----
const user = yield User.find(1)

const profile = new Profile({name: '@cybernox'})
const anotherProfile = new Profile({name: '@jgwhite'})

yield user.profile.saveMany([profile, anotherProfile])
----

==== createMany(arrayOfValues)
The `createMany` method will also create multiple records whereas you pass an array of objects instead of model instances.

[source, javascript]
----
const user = yield User.find(1)
const profiles = yield user
  .profile()
  .createMany([{name: '@cybernox'}, {name: 'jgwhite'}])
----

==== attach(rows, [pivotValues])
The `attach` method only works with *belongsToMany* relationship. You attach existing records to form a relationship.

[source, javascript]
----
const student = yield Student.find(1)
const coursesIds = yield Courses.ids()

yield Student.courses().attach(coursesIds)
----

Optionally, you can pass an object to populate fields inside the *pivotTable*.

[source, javascript]
----
yield Student.courses().attach(coursesIds, {enrollment_confirmed: false})
----

Or you can also define different pivotValues for each related row.

[source, javascript]
----
const mathsId = yield Courses
  .query()
  .where('name', 'Maths')
  .pluckId()

const englishId = yield Courses
  .query()
  .where('name', 'English')
  .pluckId()

const enrollment = {}
enrollment[mathsId] = {enrollment_confirmed: true}
enrollment[englishId] = {enrollment_confirmed: false}

yield Student.courses().attach(enrollment)
----

==== detach(rows)
The `detach` method is the opposite of the xref:_attach_rows_pivot_values[attach] and will remove the relationships from pivotTable.

NOTE: The `detach` method does not remove the rows from the related model. It just removes the relationship from the pivot table.

[source, javascript]
----
const student = yield Student.find(1)
const coursesIds = yield Courses.ids()

yield Student.courses().detach(coursesIds)
----

==== sync(rows, [pivotValues])
The `sync` will remove all existing relations and will only add given relations. Think of it as calling xref:_detach_rows[detach] and xref:_attach_rows_pivot_values[attach] together.

TIP: You can also pass *pivotValues* to the sync method similar to the attach method.

[source, javascript]
----
const student = yield Student.find(1)
const coursesIds = yield Courses.ids()

yield Student.courses().sync(coursesIds)
----

==== updatePivot(values, [relatedModelId])
In order to update the values inside the pivot table you can make use of `updatePivot` method.

[source, javascript]
----
const student = yield Student.find(1)
Student.courses().updatePivot({marks: 90})
----

Or

[source, javascript]
----
const student = yield Student.find(1)
const maths = yield Course.where('name', 'Maths').first()
Student.courses().updatePivot({marks: 90}, maths.id)
----

==== withPivot(keys)
When fetching records for *belongsToMany* lucid will not select any rows from the pivot table. In order to fetch additional fields you can make use of `withPivot` method.

NOTE: Pivot table fields will be prefixed with `\_pivot_`. In below example the marks will be returned as `_pivot_marks`

[source, javascript]
----
'use strict'

class Student extends Lucid {

  courses () {
    return this.belongsToMany('App/Model/Course').withPivot('marks')
  }

}
----

Also you can define fields when running the select query.

[source, javascript]
----
const student = yield Student.find(1)
const courses = yield student.courses().withPivot('marks').fetch()
----

==== associate(modelInstance)
The `associate` method is used with *belongsTo* relationship to associate an existing database row.

[source, javascript]
----
const user = yield User.find(1)
const profile = new Profile()
profile.name = '@cybernox'

profile.user().associate(user)
yield profile.save()
----

==== dissociate
The `dissociate` method is the opposite of xref:_associate_model_instance[associate] and will remove the existing relationship

[source, javascript]
----
const profile = yield Profile.find(1)

profile.user().dissociate()
yield profile.save()
----
