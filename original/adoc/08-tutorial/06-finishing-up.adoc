= Finishing Up

Let's finish up this tutorial by making final changes to the entire flow. Intentionally it was a simple tutorial to make you feel comfortable with the framework.

== Showing Individual Post
We have got a view listing all the blog posts. But there is no way to view a single blog post. So quickly open the routes file and register a route for same.

.app/Http/routes.js
[source, javascript]
----
Route.get('posts/:id', 'PostsController.show')
----

The `id` is a dynamic segment to pass the *post id* in the URL and access it from the controller. You can read more about link:routing#_route_parameters[Route parameters] in the docs.

Next, we need to create the view for showing a post.

[source, bash]
----
./ace make:view posts/show
----

.Output
[source]
----
create: resources/views/posts/show.njk
----


Paste the below code snippet to the showPost view.

.resources/views/posts/show.njk
[source, twig]
----
{% extends 'master' %}

{% block content %}
  <div class="post">
    <div>
      <a href="/">  Go Back </a>
    </div>
    <hr>
    <h2>{{ post.title }}</h2>
    <p>{{ post.content }}</p>
  </div>
{% endblock %}
----

Finally, we need the `PostsController.show` method to fetch the post from the database and send to it view.

.app/Http/Controllers/PostsController.js
[source, javascript]
----
'use strict'

class PostsController {

  * show (request, response) {
    const post = yield Post.find(request.param('id'))
    yield response.sendView('posts.show', { post: post.toJSON() })
  }

}
----

This time, we make use of the `find` method to fetch the post for a given id, and finally, we send the json representation of the post to the view. We are not done yet. Let's open the *home.njk* view and add the link to the individual post.

.resources/views/home.njk
[source, twig]
----
<h2><a href="posts/{{ post.id }}"> {{ post.title }} </a></h2>
----

Now refresh the browser and click on the individual posts to view a particular post.

== Link To Add A New Post
So far we have been visiting `post/create` route manually to create a new post. Let's add a link on the home page. Paste the below code snippet just before the posts-wrapper div.

.resources/views/home.njk
[source, html]
----
<div>
  <p>
    Below is the list of all the awesome posts created by all of us. You can also
    contribute by clicking the below button.
  </p>
  <a href="posts/create" class="btn btn-success btn-block"> Create New Post </a>
  <hr>
</div>
----

Now, we have a big shiny button linked to the post create route.

== Ordering Posts
Another thing we should fix is to list the posts in *desc order*, so that the recent post always shows on the top.

.app/Http/Controllers/PostsController.js
[source, javascript]
----
'use strict'

class PostsController {

  * index (request, response) {
    const posts = yield Post.query().orderBy('id', 'desc').fetch()
    yield response.sendView('home', { posts: posts.toJSON() })
  }

}
----

Now refresh the page and you will find the most recent post on the top instead of bottom.

== Summary
In the series of these tutorials, we learned a lot about the framework and tools offered by it. This is just the beginning, check out the documentation and cookbooks to explore new and expressive ways of writing maintainable code.
