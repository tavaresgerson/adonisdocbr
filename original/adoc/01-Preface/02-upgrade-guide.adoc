= Upgrading from 4.0

toc::[]

The 4.1 release contains a number of *bug fixes* and *API improvements* to keep the code base simple and less magical. Breaking changes were kept to a minimum, however, they could not be eliminated entirely.

== Getting started

The first step is to update all dependencies.

We use link:https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm-check[npm-check] to pull the latest versions of packages:

[source, bash]
----
> npm install -g npm-check
----

Run the following command to update dependencies interactively:

[source, bash]
----
> npm-check -u
----

== Exception handling
One of the most significant changes has been to the link:https://github.com/adonisjs/adonis-framework/issues/718[global exception handler, window="_blank"].

NOTE: If you never created the global exception handler, feel free to ignore this section.

Make the following changes to the `app/Exceptions/Handler.js` file.

1. Ensure your exception handler extends the `BaseExceptionHandler`:
+
[source, js]
----
const BaseExceptionHandler = use('BaseExceptionHandler')

class ExceptionHandler extends BaseExceptionHandler {
}
----

2. Call `super.handle` for exceptions you don't want to handle:
+
[source, js]
----
class ExceptionHandler extends BaseExceptionHandler {
  async handle (error, { response }) {
    if (error.name === 'UserNotFoundException') {
      // handle it yourself
      return
    }

    super.handle(...arguments)
  }
}
----

3. Lastly, you can remove `Exception.bind` calls from your codebase, since all exceptions will be routed to the global exception handler.

== Routing

==== Route.url

`Route.url` generates a fully qualified URL to a pre-registered route.

Previously, `domain` was passed as a string literal.

`domain` is now accepted as an object.

Previously:
[source, js]
----
Route.url('posts/:id', { id: 1 }, 'blog.adonisjs.com')
----

Now:
[source, js]
----
Route.url('posts/:id', { id: 1 }, { domain: 'blog.adonisjs.com' })
----

== Validator
The validator provider now uses the latest version of link:https://indicative.adonisjs.com[Indicative, window="_blank"], causing the following breaking changes.

==== formatters
There concept of named formatters no longer exists.

If you want to use a pre-existing formatter, instead of passing by name, you must now pass by reference.

Previously:
[source, js]
----
const { validate } = use('Validator')
validate(data, rules, messages, 'jsonapi')
----

Now:
[source, js]
----
const { validate, formatters } = use('Validator')
validate(data, rules, messages, formatters.JsonApi)
----

The same applies to route validators too.

Previously:
[source, js]
----
class StoreUser {
  get formatter () {
    return 'jsonapi'
  }
}
----

Now:
[source, js]
----
const { formatters } = use('Validator')

class StoreUser {
  get formatter () {
    return formatters.JsonApi
  }
}
----

==== configure
The new version of Indicative exposes the link:http://indicative.adonisjs.com/docs/api/configure[configure, window="_blank"] method to define library-wide defaults:

[source, js]
----
const { formatters, configure } = use('Validator')

configure({
  FORMATTER: formatters.JsonApi
})
----

== Views

==== css

The `css` global has been changed to `style`. The `css` global is no longer supported

Earlier
[source, edge]
----
{{ css('style') }}
----

Now
[source, edge]
----
{{ style('style') }}
----

== Lucid
Previously, date formatting was inconsistent with newly created records and existing records.

This has been fixed in the newer release with a *small breaking change* (make sure to read the link:https://github.com/adonisjs/adonis-lucid/issues/245[related issue]).

==== dates
The date fields no longer cast to `moment` instances on the model instance.

Previously:
[source, js]
----
const user = await User.find(1)
user.created_at instanceof moment // true
----

Now:
[source, js]
----
const user = await User.find(1)
user.created_at instanceof moment // false
----

This change prevents you from mutating the date on the model instance directly and instead use the `castDates` hook to mutate the date when you serialize model properties.

The `castDates` hook works as it did previously:

[source, js]
----
class User extends Model {
  static castDates (field, value) {
    if (field === 'dob') {
      return `${value.fromNow(true)} old`
    }
    return super.formatDates(field, value)
  }
}
----

== Goodies
A number of bug fixes have been applied to keep the codebase reliable.

Also, a handful of performance improvements have been implemented.

==== Validator
Since Indicative is rewritten from the ground up, the new version is *2x faster* than it was previously.

==== Middleware
Middleware is now resolved by the middleware parsing layer at the time of **booting** the app, instantiating a new instance of them for each request (previously, the **resolve** process was used for each request).

==== Better errors
Errors will now appear nicely formatted in your terminal as shown below:
