= Error & Exceptions Handling

toc::[]

AdonisJs takes an additional step towards handling and throwing exceptions by making sure exceptions thrown by the core of the framework are more descriptive and helpful for debugging. Also, it offers additional tools & practices to structure well-designed exception messages.

== Why Are Exceptions Important?
Exceptions do not get the care they deserve. The majority of programmers thinks of exceptions a way of terminating the process as something bad happened. Even worse exception messages do not share much context on how to fix the problem and leaves it to the end-user to figure out the cause.

With AdonisJs we tag all exceptions with a unique *Error code* and you can refer the documentation of the given error code to understand the cause of the exception.

Not only that, but we also offer you a nice npm package called link:https://npmjs.org/package/node-exceptions[node-exceptions, window="_blank"] to setup application specific exception classes to throw personal and meaningful exceptions.

== Error Codes
Below is the list of error codes thrown by the core of AdonisJs. You can reference them to understand the context of the exception.

All exceptions are divided into multiple categories like *General*, *Database*, *Redis*, etc.

=== General
General exceptions are raised from any part of the framework.

== Throwing Exceptions
It is recommended to throw a contextual exception since it makes it easier for the end user to act upon them. AdonisJs makes use of link:https://npmjs.org/package/node-exceptions[node-exception, window="_blank"] an npm module to structure exceptions. You can learn more about it via its documentation.

== Catching Exception
Exceptions can be caught by wrapping your code inside a `try/catch` block, or you can handle them globally by listening to the `error` event.

.app/Listeners/Http.js
[source, javascript]
----
Http.handleError = function * (error, request, response) {
  if (error.name === 'ModelNotFoundException') { <1>
    yield response.status(404).sendView('404')
    return
  }

  if (error.name === 'PasswordMisMatch') { <2>
    response.status(400).send('Invalid credentials')
    return
  }

  response.status(error.status).send(error.message) <3>
}
----

With the help of custom exceptions, it is so easy to catch them with their *name* and return a personalized response for each exception type.

<1> Handling *ModelNotFoundException* exception thrown by Lucid model `findOrFail` method and returning a *404* view.
<2> Handling *PasswordMisMatch* exception thrown by link:authentication#_attempt_uid_password[authentication provider] and return a *400* status.
<3> Generic exception handling for all other exceptions.
