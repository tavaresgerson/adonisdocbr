= Seeds & Factories

toc::[]

Once you've prepared your database schema with link:migrations[migrations], the next step is to add some data. This is where database *seeds* and *factories* come into the picture.

== Seeds
Seeds are JavaScript classes containing a `run` method. Within the `run` method you are free to write any database related operations your seed requires.

Like migrations, a seed file is created using the `adonis make` command:

[source, bash]
----
> adonis make:seed User
----

.Output
[source, bash]
----
âœ” create  database/seeds/UserSeeder.js
----

Now open this file and type the following code inside it:

.database/seeds/UserSeeder.js
[source, js]
----
const Factory = use('Factory')
const Database = use('Database')

class UserSeeder {
  async run () {
    const users = await Database.table('users')
    console.log(users)
  }
}

module.exports = UserSeeder
----

Run the seed file by calling the `adonis seed` command, which will execute the `run` method on all existing seed files.

Since you can write any database related code inside your seed files and execute them from the command line, they are helpful in offloading some tasks from your actual application code.

However, the real power of seeds is unlocked when combined with *Factories*.

== Factories
Factories define data structures (blueprints) used to generate dummy data.

Factory blueprints are set inside the `database/factory.js` file:

[source, js]
----
const Factory = use('Factory')
const Hash = use('Hash')

Factory.blueprint('App/Models/User', async (faker) => {
  return {
    username: faker.username(),
    email: faker.email(),
    password: await Hash.make(faker.password())
  }
})
----

When a model instance is generated from a factory blueprint, the model's attributes are prefilled using the keys defined inside the blueprint:

[source, js]
----
const user = await Factory
  .model('App/Models/User')
  .create()
----

Many model instances can be generated at the same time:

[source, js]
----
const usersArray = await Factory
  .model('App/Models/User')
  .createMany(5)
----

=== Creating Relationships
Say we want to create a `User` model and relate a `Post` to it.

NOTE: For the example below, a `posts` relationship must first be defined on the User model. Learn more about relationships link:relationships[here].

First, create blueprints for both models in the `database/factory.js` file:

.database/factory.js
[source, js]
----
// User blueprint
Factory.blueprint('App/Models/User', (faker) => {
  return {
    username: faker.username(),
    password: faker.password()
  }
})

// Post blueprint
Factory.blueprint('App/Models/Post', (faker) => {
  return {
    title: faker.sentence(),
    body: faker.paragraph()
  }
})
----

Then, create a `User`, make a `Post`, and associate both models to each other:

[source, js]
----
const user = await Factory.model('App/Models/User').create()
const post = await Factory.model('App/Models/Post').make()

await user.posts().save(post)
----

You may have noticed that we used the `make` method on the `Post` blueprint.

Unlike the `create` method, the `make` method does not persist the `Post` model to the database, instead returning an unsaved instance of the `Post` model pre-filled with dummy data (the `Post` model is saved when the `.posts().save()` method is called).

== Seed Commands
Below is the list of available seed commands.

[options="header", cols="30, 20, 50"]
|====
| Command | Options | Description
| `adonis make:seed` | None | Make a new seed file.
| `adonis seed` | `--files` | Execute seed files (you can optionally pass a comma-separated list of `--files` to be executed, otherwise, all files get executed).
|====

== Model Factory API
Below is the list of available methods when using link:lucid[Lucid model] factories.

==== create
Persist and return model instance:

[source, js]
----
await Factory
  .model('App/Models/User')
  .create()
----

==== createMany
Persist and return many model instances:

[source, js]
----
await Factory
  .model('App/Models/User')
  .createMany(3)
----

==== make
Return model instance but do not persist it to the database:

[source, js]
----
await Factory
  .model('App/Models/User')
  .make()
----

==== makeMany
Return array of model instances but do not persist them to the database:

[source, js]
----
await Factory
  .model('App/Models/User')
  .makeMany(3)
----

== Usage Without Lucid
If your application doesn't use link:lucid[Lucid models] you can still use the link:query-builder[Database Provider] to generate factory database records.

==== blueprint

To define your factory blueprint without Lucid, pass a table name as the first parameter instead of a model name (e.g. `users` instead of `App/Models/User`):

[source, js]
----
Factory.blueprint('users', (faker) => {
  return {
    username: faker.username(),
    password: faker.password()
  }
})
----

==== create
Created a table record:

[source, js]
----
run () {
  await Factory.get('users').create()
}
----

==== table
Define a different table name at runtime:

[source, js]
----
await Factory
  .get('users')
  .table('my_users')
  .create()
----

==== returning
For PostgreSQL, define a returning column:

[source, js]
----
await Factory
  .get('users')
  .returning('id')
  .create()
----

==== connection
Choose a different connection at runtime:

[source, js]
----
await Factory
  .get('users')
  .connection('mysql')
  .returning('id')
  .create()
----

==== createMany
Create multiple records:

[source, js]
----
await Factory
  .get('users')
  .createMany(3)
----

== Custom Data
The methods `make`, `makeMany`, `create` and `createMany` accept a custom data object which is passed directly to your blueprints.

For example:

[source, js]
----
const user = await Factory
  .model('App/Models/User')
  .create({ status: 'admin' })
----

Inside your blueprint, your custom data object is consumed like so:

[source, js]
----
Factory.blueprint('App/Models/User', async (faker, i, data) => {
  return {
    username: faker.username(),
    status: data.status
  }
})
----

== Faker API
The `faker` object passed to a factory blueprint is a reference to the link:http://chancejs.com[Chance, window="_blank"] random generator JavaScript library.

Make sure to read Chance's link:http://chancejs.com[documentation, window="_blank"] for the full list of available `faker` methods and properties.

== FAQ's
Since factories and seeds fit many different use cases you might be confused how/when to use them, so here is a list of frequently asked questions.

[ol-spaced]
1. *Do factories and seeds have to be used together?* +
  No. Factories and seeds are not dependent upon each other and can be used independently. For example, you could just use seed files to import data into an AdonisJs app from a completely different app.

2. *Can I use factories when writing tests?* +
  Yes. Import the factory provider (`Factory`) into your test and use as required.

3. *Can I run only selected seed files?* +
  Yes. Passing `--files` with a list of comma-separated filenames to the `adonis seed` command ensures only those files are run, for example:
+
[source, bash]
----
> adonis seed --files='UsersSeeder.js, PostsSeeder.js'
