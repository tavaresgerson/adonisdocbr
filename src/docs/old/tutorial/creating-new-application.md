# Creating a new application

Let's start by creating a new application on top of **web starter kit**. Starter kits in AdonisJS are pre-configured project structures to create a certain style of application.

You can always refer the documentation to [learn more about starter kits](../docs/installation.md#starter-kits). But, for this tutorial, make sure to select the web starter kit as it includes everything we need to create build the Hacker News clone.

```sh
npm init adonisjs@latest
```

Once done, you can start the development server using the `serve` command and view the welcome page in your browser by visiting the [http://localhost:3333](http://localhost:3333) URL.

```sh
node ace serve --watch
```

## Exploring configured packages

Let's kill the development server by pressing `Ctrl+C` on your keyboard and explore the packages installed and configured by the web starter kit.

```json

}
