summary: Learn how to send real-time updates with SSE from your AdonisJS server using the Transmit package
---

# Transmit

Transmit is a native opinionated Server-Sent-Event (SSE) module built for AdonisJS. It is a simple and efficient way to send real-time updates to the client, such as notifications, live chat messages, or any other type of real-time data.

:::note
The data transmission occurs only from server to client, not the other way around. You have to use a form or a fetch request to achieve client to server communication.
:::

## Installation

Install and configure the package using the following command :

```sh
node ace add @adonisjs/transmit
```

:::disclosure{title="See steps performed by the add command"}

1. Installs the `@adonisjs/transmit` package using the detected package manager.
 
2. Registers the `@adonisjs/transmit/transmit_provider` service provider inside the `adonisrc.ts` file.
 
3. Creates a new `transmit.ts` file inside the `config` directory.
 
:::

You will also have to install the Transmit client package to listen for events on the client-side.

```sh
npm install @adonisjs/transmit-client
```

## Configuration

The configuration for the transmit package is stored within the `config/transmit.ts` file.

See also: [Config stub](https://github.com/adonisjs/transmit/blob/main/stubs/config/transmit.stub)

```ts
import { defineConfig } from '@adonisjs/transmit'

export default defineConfig({
  pingInterval: false,
  transport: null,
})
```

<dl>

<dt>

pingInterval

</dt>

<dd>

The interval used to send ping messages to the client. The value is in milliseconds or using a string `Duration` format (i.e: `10s`). Set to `false` to disable ping messages.

</dd>

<dt>

transport

</dt>

<dd>

Transmit supports syncing events across multiple servers or instances. You can enable the feature by referencing the wanted transport layer (only `redis` is supported for now). Set to `null` to disable syncing.

```ts
import env from '#start/env'
import { defineConfig } from '@adonisjs/transmit'
import { redis } from '@adonisjs/transmit/transports'

export default defineConfig({
  transport: {
    driver: redis({
      host: env.get('REDIS_HOST'),
      port: env.get('REDIS_PORT'),
      password: env.get('REDIS_PASSWORD'),
      keyPrefix: 'transmit',
    })
  }
})
```

:::note
Ensure you have `ioredis` installed when using the `redis` transport.
:::

</dd>

## Register Routes

You have to register the transmit routes to allow the client to connect to the server. The routes are registered manually.

```ts
// title: start/routes.ts
import transmit from '@adonisjs/transmit/services/main'

transmit.registerRoutes()
````

You can also register each route manually by binding the controller by hand.

```ts
// title: start/routes.ts
const EventStreamController = () => import('@adonisjs/transmit/controllers/event_stream_controller')
const SubscribeController = () => import('@adonisjs/transmit/controllers/subscribe_controller')
const UnsubscribeController = () => import('@adonisjs/transmit/controllers/unsubscribe_controller')

router.get('/__transmit/events', [EventStreamController])
router.post('/__transmit/subscribe', [SubscribeController])
router.post('/__transmit/unsubscribe', [UnsubscribeController])
```

If you want to modify the route definition, for example, to use the [`Rate Limiter`](../security/rate_limiting.md) and auth middleware to avoid abuse of some transmit routes, you can either change the route definition or pass a callback to the `transmit.registerRoutes` method.

```ts
// title: start/routes.ts
import transmit from '@adonisjs/transmit/services/main'

transmit.registerRoutes((route) => {
  // Ensure you are authenticated to register your client
  if (route.getPattern() === '__transmit/events') {
    route.middleware(middleware.auth())
    return
  }

  // Add a throttle middleware to other transmit routes
  route.use(throttle)
})
```

## Channels

Channels are used to group events. For example, you can have a channel for notifications, another for chat messages, and so on.
They are created on the fly when the client subscribes to them.

### Channel Names

Channel names are used to identify the channel. They are case-sensitive and must be a string. You cannot use any special characters or spaces in the channel name except `/`. The following are some examples of valid channel names:

```ts
import transmit from '@adonisjs/transmit/services/main'

transmit.broadcast('global', { message: 'Hello' })
transmit.broadcast('chats/1/messages', { message: 'Hello' })
transmit.broadcast('users/1', { message: 'Hello' })
```

:::tip
Channel names use the same syntax as route in AdonisJS but are not related to them. You can freely define a http route and a channel with the same key.
:::

### Channel Authorization

You can authorize or reject a connection to a channel using the `authorize` method. The method receives the channel name and the `HttpContext`. It must return a boolean value.

```ts
// title: start/transmit.ts

import transmit from '@adonisjs/transmit/services/main'
import Chat from '#models/chat'
import type { HttpContext } from '@adonisjs/core/http'

transmit.authorize<{ id: string }>('users/:id', (ctx: HttpContext, { id }) => {
  return ctx.auth.user?.id === +id
})

transmit.authorize<{ id: string }>('chats/:id/messages', async (ctx: HttpContext, { id }) => {
  const chat = await Chat.findOrFail(+id)
  
  return ctx.bouncer.allows('accessChat', chat)
})
```

## Broadcasting Events

You can broadcast events to a channel using the `broadcast` method. The method receives the channel name and the data to send.

```ts
import transmit from '@adonisjs/transmit/services/main'

transmit.broadcast('global', { message: 'Hello' })
```

You can also broadcast events to any channel except one using the `broadcastExcept` method. The method receives the channel name, the data to send, and the UID you want to ignore.

```ts
transmit.broadcastExcept('global', { message: 'Hello' }, 'uid-of-sender')
```

### Syncing across multiple servers or instances

By default, broadcasting events works only within the context of an HTTP request. However, you can broadcast events from the background using the `transmit` service if you register a `transport` in your configuration.

The transport layer is responsible for syncing events across multiple servers or instances. It works by broadcasting any events (like broadcasted events, subscriptions, and un-subscriptions) to all connected servers or instances using a `Message Bus`.

The server or instance responsible for your client connection will receive the event and broadcast it to the client.

## Transmit Client

You can listen for events on the client-side using the `@adonisjs/transmit-client` package. The package provides a `Transmit` class. The client use the [`EventSource`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventSource) API by default to connect to the server.

```ts
import { Transmit } from '@adonisjs/transmit-client'

export const transmit = new Transmit({
  baseUrl: window.location.origin
})
```

:::tip
You should create only one instance of the `Transmit` class and reuse it throughout your application.
:::

### Configuring the Transmit Instance

The `Transmit` class accepts an object with the following properties:

<dl>

<dt>

baseUrl

</dt>

<dd>

The base URL of the server. The URL must include the protocol (http or https) and the domain name.

</dd>

<dt>

uidGenerator

</dt>

<dd>

A function that generates a unique identifier for the client. The function must return a string. It defaults to `crypto.randomUUID`.

</dd>

<dt>

eventSourceFactory

</dt>

<dd>

A function that creates a new `EventSource` instance. It defaults to the WebAPI [`EventSource`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventSource). You need to provide a custom implementation if you want to use the client on `Node.js`, `React Native` or any other environment that does not support the `EventSource` API.

</dd>

<dt>

eventTargetFactory 

</dt>

<dd>

A function that creates a new `EventTarget` instance. It defaults to the WebAPI [`EventTarget`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget). You need to provide a custom implementation if you want to use the client on `Node.js`, `React Native` or any other environment that does not support the `EventTarget` API. Return `null` to disable the `EventTarget` API.

</dd>

<dt>

httpClientFactory

</dt>

<dd>

A function that creates a new `HttpClient` instance. It is mainly used for testing purposes.

</dd>

<dt>

beforeSubscribe

</dt>

<dd>

A function that is called before subscribing to a channel. It receives the channel name and the `Request` object sent to the server. Use this function to add custom headers or modify the request object.

</dd>

<dt>

beforeUnsubscribe

</dt>

<dd>

A function that is called before unsubscribing from a channel. It receives the channel name and the `Request` object sent to the server. Use this function to add custom headers or modify the request object.

</dd>

<dt>

maxReconnectAttempts

</dt>

<dd>

The maximum number of reconnection attempts. It defaults to `5`.

</dd>

<dt>

onReconnectAttempt

</dt>

<dd>

A function that is called before each reconnection attempt and receives the number of attempts made so far. Use this function to add custom logic.

</dd>

<dt>

onReconnectFailed

</dt>

<dd>

A function that is called when the reconnection attempts fail. Use this function to add custom logic.

</dd>

<dt>

onSubscribeFailed

</dt>

<dd>

A function that is called when the subscription fails. It receives the `Response` object. Use this function to add custom logic.

</dd>

<dt>

onSubscription

</dt>

<dd>

A function that is called when the subscription is successful. It receives the channel name. Use this function to add custom logic.

</dd>

<dt>

onUnsubscription

</dt>

<dd>

A function that is called when the unsubscription is successful. It receives the channel name. Use this function to add custom logic.

</dd>

</dl>


### Creating a Subscription

You can create a subscription to a channel using the `subscription` method. The method receives the channel name.

```ts
const subscription = transmit.subscription('chats/1/messages')
await subscription.create()
```

The `create` method registers the subscription on the server. It returns a promise that you can `await` or `void`.

:::note
If you don't call the `create` method, the subscription will not be registered on the server, and you will not receive any events.
:::

### Listening for Events

You can listen for events on the subscription using the `onMessage` method that receives a callback function. You can call the `onMessage` method multiple times to add different callbacks.

```ts
subscription.onMessage((data) => {
  console.log(data)
})
```

You can also listen to a channel only once using the `onMessageOnce` method which receives a callback function.

```ts
subscription.onMessageOnce(() => {
  console.log('I will be called only once')
})
```

### Stop Listening for Events

The `onMessage` and `onMessageOnce` methods return a function that you can call to stop listening for a specific callback.

```ts
const stopListening = subscription.onMessage((data) => {
  console.log(data)
})

// Stop listening
stopListening()
```

### Deleting a Subscription

You can delete a subscription using the `delete` method. The method returns a promise that you can `await` or `void`. This method will unregister the subscription on the server.

```ts
await subscription.delete()
```

## Avoiding GZip Interference

When deploying applications that use `@adonisjs/transmit`, it’s important to ensure that GZip compression does not interfere with the `text/event-stream` content type used by Server-Sent Events (SSE). Compression applied to `text/event-stream` can cause connection issues, leading to frequent disconnects or SSE failures.

If your deployment uses a reverse proxy (such as Traefik or Nginx) or other middleware that applies GZip, ensure that compression is disabled for the `text/event-stream` content type.

### Example Configuration for Traefik

```plaintext
traefik.http.middlewares.gzip.compress=true
traefik.http.middlewares.gzip.compress.excludedcontenttypes=text/event-stream
traefik.http.routers.my-router.middlewares=gzip
```
